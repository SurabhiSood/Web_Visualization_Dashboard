# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Create a dashboard using HTML and CSS to the analysis we've done.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard

For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website 

The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A 'landing page' containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.

* Four 'visualization pages', each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

* A 'Comparisons page' that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.

* A 'Data page' that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    
The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
